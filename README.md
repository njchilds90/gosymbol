# go-sympy

A lightweight symbolic mathematics library for Go, inspired by Python's SymPy.

Currently provides basic symbolic expressions, arithmetic operations, pretty-printing (precedence-aware with fewer unnecessary parentheses), and derivative computation.

This is an early-stage project (started Feb 18, 2026) — focused on core expression handling and printing.
