# go-sympy

A minimal symbolic mathematics library for Go, inspired by Python's SymPy.

Supports symbolic expressions, arithmetic (+ − × / ^ negation), trig/exp/log/sqrt functions, precedence-aware pretty-printing, differentiation (product/chain/general power rule), basic simplification, string parsing, numerical evaluation, simple expansion, basic integration, and linear/quadratic equation solving.

Single-file, zero dependencies. Very early prototype (all development on Feb 18, 2026).

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/njchilds90/go-sympy
